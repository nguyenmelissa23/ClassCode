With your group, answer each of the following questions using the ReactJS Documentation:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part I:
1. What are the benefits of using ReactJS?

- Work through virtual DOM so processing info on the client side would be less. 
- See the logic and html components on one file. Help with the flow logic of the page. 
- Code reuse
- Render react on Server.

2. What is the significance of the React.createClass() method?
- create component class.

3. What is the significance of the ReactDOM.render() function?
- create/update component in an element

4. What is JSX? Why does React recommend it? (Hint: See documentation on "Displaying Data")
- JavaScript XML 
- JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children so it helps make React more elegant

5. How do I incorporate a JSX script into my HTML? (Hint: See documentation on "Displaying Data")


6. What is Babel? And what role does it play in converting JSX into vanilla JavaScript?
- transform syntax? 
- Convert JSX syntax and strip out type annotations. 
- Turn JSX into React function calls

7. What is the significance of { } curly braces in JSX? (Hint: See "JSX in Depth")
- js syntax 

8. What is the difference between a prop and a state? (Hint: See articles on "Thinking in React", "Interactivity and Dynamic UIs")
- props: object argument with data and returns a react element 
- call such components "functional" because they are JS functions 

9. Create a Simple Hello World Application with React


Part II:
- Note at least 1-3 questions, curiosities, or mysteries you stumble into as you tread through the ReactJS documentation

Part III:
- If you finish early, begin reading and working through the ReactJS Tutorial: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html
